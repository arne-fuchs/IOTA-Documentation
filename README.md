# IOTA-Documentation
Frank's IOTA / Shimmer Documentation

## Why another documentation?

This documentation will not be a complete documentation of the whole IOTA / Shimmer framework but should be used as an extension of the other. In the past I personally made the experience that the IF did remove some documentation as e.g. the documentation how to create a genesis block and how to set up the coordinator for it. I also made the mistake to use the discord server as documentation until the cleaned up and reworked the whole discord server, removing channels from where I extracted information.
