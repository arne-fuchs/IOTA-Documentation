   ```
5. ```bash
   npm install && npm run build
   ```

   cd ..
   ```
7. ```bash
   ./build.sh && go build
   ```
   
## Setting password for login

To generate a password hash, and it's salt you need to clone and build <a href=https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet>Hornet</a>

After building use hornet tools to generate the password hash:
```bash
./hornet tools pwd-hash
```

You can set the hash and the salt with these parameters:
```bash
./inx-dashboard --dashboard.auth.passwordHash YOURHASH --dashboard.auth.passwordSalt YOURSALT
```

Do not forget to change username with ```--dashboard.auth.username```

## Getting full list of parameters

```bash
./inx-dashboard --help --full
```
